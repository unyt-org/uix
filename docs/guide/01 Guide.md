# The UIX Guide

This guide introduces some important concepts and paradigms for developing applications with [UIX](https://github.com/unyt-orguix) / [DATEX](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-core-js-legacy).
We recommend that you read this guide before starting to develop a UIX application to fully understand the concepts and capabilities of the framework.

## What is UIX?
UIX is a full-stack framework for building web applications running on the [Deno runtime](https://deno.com) for JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides a complete environment for building *single- and multi page* applications with frontend or server-side rendering and hydration.

### What is a Full-Stack Framework?
A full-stack framework provides everything you need to build both the front-end (client-side) and the back-end (server-side) of an application in a unified environment. That typically includes:

* **Routing**: To handle HTTP requests and serve responses.
* **Templating/Rendering**: For generating dynamic and reusable UI.
* **Various tools**: Supporting developing, testing, and deploying web applications.

UIX is designed to provide these components seamlessly, by utilizing Denoâ€™s capabilities to manage both the server-side logic and the client-side interactions.

### How UIX Works with Deno
UIX leverages Deno as its underlying runtime environment. However, it uses a custom runtime specifically tailored for UIX apps, called ["Deno for UIX"](https://github.com/unyt-org/deno). Deno for UIX allows for improved reactivity syntax to be used in UIX projects. That special behaviors make UIX suited for building and deploying modern web apps.

UIX also installs a module that acts as a command-line executable (uix), which interacts directly with Deno to handle project setup, runtime, and deployment.

To get started with UIX, you need to install the `uix` command:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://unyt.land/install.sh | bash
```

The script will install the custom [Deno for UIX](https://github.com/unyt-org/deno) executable into `~/.uix/bin/deno`.

In the second step the script then installs the `uix` executable into `~/.uix/bin/uix` using the [Deno script installer](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/script_installer/).

The install script will add the `~/.uix/bin/` path to the system `$PATH` environment variable. That allows for using the `deno` and `uix` commandlet inside of the terminal.

The installed `uix` command is a wrapper that, behind the scenes, executes the following script:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
# generated by deno install
exec deno run --allow-all --quiet --import-map 'https://cdn.unyt.org/uix/importmap.json' --no-config 'https://cdn.unyt.org/uix/run.ts' "$@"
```

This script invokes the [UIX runner](https://cdn.unyt.org/uix/run.ts) (`run.ts`), which handles UIX auto updates, and deployment. The runner verifies passed CLI arguments (e.g., --watch, --port), and starts another Deno process for launching your current UIX app with the passed configuration parameters.
