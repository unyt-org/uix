# The UIX Guide

This guide introduces some important concepts and paradigms for developing applications with [UIX](https://github.com/unyt-orguix) / [DATEX](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-core-js-legacy).
We recommend that you read this guide before starting to develop a UIX application to fully understand the concepts and capabilities of the framework.

## What is UIX?
UIX is a full-stack framework for building web applications running on the [Deno runtime](https://deno.com) for JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides a complete environment for building *single- and multi page* applications with frontend or server-side rendering and hydration.

### What is a Full-Stack Framework?
A full-stack framework provides everything you need to build both the front-end (client-side) and the back-end (server-side) of an application in a unified environment. That typically includes:

* **Routing**: To handle HTTP requests and serve responses.
* **Templating/Rendering**: For generating dynamic and reusable UI.
* **Various tools**: Supporting developing, testing, and deploying web applications.

UIX is designed to provide these components seamlessly, by utilizing Denoâ€™s capabilities to manage both the server-side logic and the client-side interactions.
